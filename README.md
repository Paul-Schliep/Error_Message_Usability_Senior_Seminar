# Usability of Error Messages for Introductory Students

##University of Minnesota - Morris Computer Science Senior Seminar paper and presentation: by Paul Schliep

My goal is to discuss how well error messages in programming languages can help novice programmers find mistakes in their programs and what aspects make an error message more user-friendly for introductory computer science students. I will also be discussing several methodologies used to help improve the experience a novice programmer has when attempting to understand causes for errors.
