This paper discusses new results in NP-complete problems and the use of distributed
networks to solve certain partial cases of NP-complete problems.

\section{Introduction}
I will focus on using the approach Blah for solving partial cases of
NP-complete problems on distributed networks.

I plan to use the following sources:
\begin{itemize}
\item I expect~\cite{OM:2008} to be one of my main sources, and I'm still looking for another two ``core'' papers to build on.
\item I may use~\cite{Brun:2008} for comparison. 
\item I'll use~\cite{Aaronson:2005, wiki:np-complete} and possibly selected chapters of~\cite{Garey:1979} as background. 
\end{itemize}

As mentioned above I need two other ``core'' papers, and I'm still looking for good examples that I can use to explain the 

I was initially considering algorithms on compete graphs as a possible topic, and looked over~\cite{winkler1984isometric, dobkin1987delaunay, folkman1970graphs} before I settled on my current topic.

% The following two commands are all you need to
% produce the bibliography for the citations in your paper.
\bibliographystyle{abbrv}
% annotated_bibliography.bib is the name of the BibTex file containing 
% all the bibliography entries for this example. Note that you *don't* include the .bib ending
% in the \bibliography command.
\bibliography{annotated_bibliography}  

% You must have a ".bib" file and remember to run:
%     pdflatex bibtex pdflatex pdflatex
% in order to see all the citation references correctly.
